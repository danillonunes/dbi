DBI: the simple database interactive manager

DBI is a PHP script meant to handle simple MySQL tasks such as database creation, backup, restore and deletion.

DBI follows an unsafe standard to be used only on local or development servers and assume some conventions of how to work with databases in a development environment with ease, like using the same name for user, database name and password.

To install it, just unpack it in any directory (like /opt/dbi) and create a symbolic link in any directory from your PATH (like /usr/bin) to dbi.
